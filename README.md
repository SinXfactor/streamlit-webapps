# Streamlit-webapps  
### Basic-ml: Simple streamlit visualization app  
* Different `sklearn` toy-datasets like *Iris dataset, Breast cancer dataset & Wine dataset* are vizualized graphically using `matplotlib` library in the streamlit app. The datasets are classified with different supervised ML classifiers like *KNN, SVM & Random Forests*.  
* **Shape of the dataset, no. of classes** along with its **accuracy score** for particular classifier are displayed above the graph. There is also a sidebar to tweak certain parameters related to the different classifiers used.

### Sklearn's generated datasets  
* This app is used to check the influence of various parameters/arguments on the sample data points of generated datasets.
* Variuos generated datasets include: make_moons, make_circles & make_classification which creates two interleaving data points for classification purposes.
* Used to visualize clustering and classification algorithms.
